# Reproduction of an Internal Risk Model for Equities ‚Äì Student-t Calibration and SCR Estimation on CAC 40

This repository contains part of a quantitative research project conducted during an internship at **Generali** as part of the **Master 2 in Mathematical Modeling and Methods in Economics and Finance** at **Universit√© Paris 1 Panth√©on-Sorbonne**.

## üìå Project Overview

**Title:**  
_Reproduction of an internal equity risk model: calibration using the Student-t distribution and SCR estimation on CAC 40 data_

**Objective:**  
To reproduce and validate a Solvency II-compliant internal model for market risk on equity assets, using monthly CAC 40 data. The key goals include:

- Regulatory background analysis (Solvency II & SCR computation)
- Preprocessing of CAC 40 returns and log-return computation
- Calibration of the Student-t distribution via Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)
- Estimation of VaR at 99.5% confidence level
- Comparison with the standard formula SCR
- Model validation: sensitivity analysis, backtesting, and stress scenarios
- Full implementation using **Python on Dataiku**

## üõ† Work in Progress

The Python code is currently being developed and executed in **Dataiku**, a collaborative data science platform.

### Current Dataiku Flow

Below is the current state of the workflow built in Dataiku:

**Explanation:**
- **CAC_40_Time_Series_**: Input dataset (monthly historical data)
- **Python Recipe**: Preprocessing, cleaning, log-return calculation
- **Test**: Output dataset (transformed and enriched)
- **output_folder**: File export for post-processing and reporting
